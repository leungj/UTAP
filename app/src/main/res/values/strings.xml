        Have you watched "interstellar" yet? The movie is freaking awesome!
        The part where they land on that planet and the waves were like "woosh" and "waash".
        Then they were stuck there for like an hour but every hour was 7 hours on Earth
        and when they got back everyone got old and it was crazy!\n
        Oh also the end when we find out all the supernatural things were actually created by
        humans from the future? OMG!!\n
        Well, hope I did not spoil the movie for you. Ohohohohoh!\n
        Which movie do you think is better? \n
        Interstellar or Inception? \n
        How about... \n
        Interstellar and Dark Knight? \n
        Let me know what you think </string>
